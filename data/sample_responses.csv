Why do you support / not support the bus priority measures?,"I support the bus priority measures because they will make bus journeys more reliable and reduce delays. This will encourage more people to use public transport instead of driving, which is better for the environment. However, I think we need more frequent bus services to make this work effectively."
What are your views on the proposed cycle lane?,"I'm concerned about the cycle lane taking up too much road space and causing more congestion for cars. While I support cycling in principle, I think this particular design will create problems for local businesses and residents who rely on car access."
How do you feel about the pedestrianization of the high street?,"The pedestrianization would make the area much more pleasant and safer for shoppers. It would reduce air pollution and noise, creating a better environment for local businesses. I'm particularly concerned about accessibility for elderly and disabled people though."
What are your thoughts on the new park and ride scheme?,"The park and ride is a great idea as it will reduce traffic in the city center. The location is convenient and the frequency of buses seems good. However, the parking charges are too high and might put people off using it."
Do you support the introduction of a congestion charge?,"I strongly oppose the congestion charge as it will unfairly impact low-income workers who have no choice but to drive. The public transport alternatives aren't good enough yet, and this feels like a tax on working people."
What are your views on the proposed tram extension?,"The tram extension would be fantastic for connecting more areas of the city. It's a clean, efficient mode of transport that would reduce car dependency. The construction period might be disruptive, but the long-term benefits outweigh this."
How do you feel about the 20mph speed limit in residential areas?,"I fully support the 20mph limit as it makes our streets safer for children and pedestrians. It's particularly important near schools and parks. The slower speed also reduces noise pollution in residential areas."
What are your thoughts on the electric vehicle charging points?,"The new charging points are a step in the right direction, but there aren't enough of them. The locations aren't very convenient, and the charging speed is too slow. We need more investment in this infrastructure."
Do you support the introduction of a low traffic neighborhood?,"The low traffic neighborhood has made our area much more pleasant to live in. There's less through traffic, making it safer for children to play outside. The air quality has improved significantly."
What are your views on the proposed bus gate?,"The bus gate will cause significant delays for local residents trying to access their homes. While I understand the need to prioritize buses, this particular location will create major problems for the surrounding area."
